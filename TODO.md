 - Ensure I'm testing all base functions for the classes
  - [DONE] dict
  - list
  - [DONE] tuple
  - set
  - string
 - Un-implement list functions from tuple...
  - Shouldn't be able to do "remove" from tuple, for instance.
 - Integrate tests into Travis
  - Update README.md with badge
 - Integrate coveralls results into coveralls.io
  - Update README.md with badge
 - Proper documentation
 - Implement setattr override for base CoW class (propagate back up)
  - If an object updates in place (i.e.: __setattr__, function calls that update, etc), it needs to notify any object that is interested in this update.
  - Create method in CoW that will handle this: _flyweight_sync() -- small wrapper to simply call flyweight_cb_func set pointers to notify
 - Implement optimization from proxy_function_call to other places
